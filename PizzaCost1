/** 
 * The class, PizzaCost1, is an application that displays the cost of making pizza based on:
 * Diameter(specified by the user)
 * Labor cost
 * Rent cost

/** 
 * Details outlined in the question:
 * The cost of making a pizza at a local shop is as follows:
 *         Labor cost is $0.75 per pizza, regardless of size
 *         Rent cost is $1.00 per pizza, regardless of size
 *         Materials is $0.05*diameter*diameter(diameter is measured in inches)
 */
